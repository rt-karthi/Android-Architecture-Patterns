"# android-architecture-patterns" 
This Repository consist of different types of android architecture
1. MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Model: Manages the data and business logic of the app.
View: Displays the data to the user and handles UI-related code.
Controller: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling input and updating the Model or View as needed.

2. MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
Model: Same as in MVC; holds data and business logic.
View: Interface for rendering data on the screen.
Presenter: Acts as the middle layer, retrieving data from the Model and updating the View. It doesnâ€™t depend on the Android framework, making it more testable.

3. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Model: Manages data and business logic.
View: Displays data and observes the ViewModel.
ViewModel: Holds the data and business logic specifically for the UI. In Android, often used with LiveData or StateFlow to observe data changes, reducing tight coupling.

4. Clean Architecture
A layered architecture designed to keep code loosely coupled and highly testable. It often uses a combination of other architectures (like MVVM) within its layers.
Layers:
Presentation Layer: UI logic, often using MVP or MVVM.
Domain Layer: Holds business logic, often with use cases (or interactors) that encapsulate specific application features.
Data Layer: Manages data sources (e.g., network, database).

Choosing the Right Architecture
MVC: Suitable for simple applications, but may become unmanageable as complexity grows.
MVP: Good for medium-sized projects, where testability and separation of UI code are important.
MVVM: Ideal for reactive programming and modern Android development (often used with Jetpack libraries).
Clean Architecture: Best for large, complex applications that demand high modularity and testability, though it may be overkill for small apps.
